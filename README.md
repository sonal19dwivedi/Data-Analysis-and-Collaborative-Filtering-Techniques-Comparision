# eCommerce
eCommerce final project
We made use of Yelp dataset. 
Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset

How to run our code

   1.	Download the yelp dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset. Since this data is worth 10GB we could not attach         it with our submission.
   2.	Extract the dataset. Make sure that the extracted dataset is in the same directory as the project code files.
   3.	Install Python/Anaconda. Colab can also be used.
   4.	Open RestaurantDataset.ipynb file first using Anaconda.
   5.	If using Anaconda each line can be executed by pressing shift+enter. The results will be displayed after the code is executed.
   6.	Start executing the code from the very first line.
   7.	Follow the following order of files in an order to verify our results:
                          ->	RestaurantDataset.ipynb
                          ->	Categories.ipynb
                          ->	Relation_Extraction.ipynb
                          ->	CFcompare.ipynb
